android.bluetooth
    Provides classes that manage Bluetooth functionality.
    1,scanning for devices,
    2,connecting with devices,
    3,managing data transfer between devices.
    
  The Bluetooth API supports both "Classic Bluetooth" and Bluetooth Low Energy.
  The Bluetooth APIs let applications:
    1,Scan for other Bluetooth devices (including BLE devices).
    2,Query the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices.
    3,Establish RFCOMM channels/sockets.
    4,Connect to specified sockets on other devices.
    5,Transfer data to and from other devices.
    6,Communicate with BLE devices, such as proximity sensors, heart rate monitors, fitness devices, and so on.
    7,Act as a GATT client or a GATT server (BLE).
    
  To perform Bluetooth communication using these APIs, an application must declare the 
        BLUETOOTH permission. 
    Some additional functionality, such as requesting device discovery, also requires the 
        BLUETOOTH_ADMIN permission.
        
  Note: Not all Android-powered devices provide Bluetooth functionality.
